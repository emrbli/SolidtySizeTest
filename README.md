# Solidty Size Code Test 

##### If the contract triggers a function that controls the contract size through the constructor at the time the contract is first deployed, does this process happen?


👇🏻 Test this using this hardhat project.

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts
```
